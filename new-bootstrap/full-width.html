            <p><b>What is Photo-Light Therapy?</b></p>
            <p>Photo Rejuvenation works at the cellular level. Each cell contains a number of power plants, called mitochondria. The function of these power plants is to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the form of energy that can be used by the cell to function properly. The Red and Infrared spectrum of the electromagnetic radiation are used for Photo Rejuvenation because they are well absorbed by the collector surfaces of the mitochondria as an additional source of energy. The cellular power plants can thus produce more ATP. ATP is the cellular energy or fuel the skin cells strive after and need. A sufficiently high supply of cellular energy enables our skin cells to work under optimum conditions and is the essential prerequisite to ensure a successful self-healing process.</p>
            <p>Photo-Light Therapy uses visible red light, at wavelengths of 600 &ndash; 660 nanometers. These waves penetrate skin tissue to a depth of about 8 &ndash; 10mm (2/5 of inch) and are beneficial in treating problems close to the skins surface such as wounds, cuts, scars and is particularly effective in treating skin infections. The process also uses Infrared light, at wavelengths of 700 &ndash; 900 nanometers, which penetrate to a depth of about 30 &ndash; 40mm (1.5 inches). These are especially beneficial in treatment of sore joints and deep muscle tissue.    This process results in the vascular walls of the skin's small blood vessels being strengthened, thus improving oxygenation and detoxification of the skin. Hydration is increased and the ability of the skin to retain moisture improves. Increased cellular activity, improved natural repair and the creation of healthy skin conditions leads to cell regeneration.</p>

            <p><b>History</b></p>
            <p>Light Therapy has been used for over 70 years.
            <ul>
                <li>1930’s &amp; 1940’s, Drs. Knott &amp; Miley used blood irradiation to treat acute infections</li>
                <li>In the 1980’s &amp; 1990’s NASA discovered Light Therapy to be beneficial in treating “SAD” (seasonal affective disorder) and facilitating skin tissue growth and surface wound healing.</li>
                <li>Today, Light Therapy has been shown in independent research worldwide to deliver powerful therapeutic benefits to living tissue and organisms.  Clinically there have been no recorded side effects in over 1,800 publications.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Effects of Photo-Light Therapy</b></p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increases Vascularity</strong> &ndash; supplies additional oxygen and nutrients needed for healthy skin</li>
                <li><strong>Stimulates Collagen Production</strong> &ndash; the protein that holds cells together with a high degree of elasticity (reduces wrinkles)</li>
                <li><strong>Stimulates Release of ATP</strong> &ndash; ATP allows cells to readily accept nutrients &amp; expel waste products faster by increasing cellular energy</li>
                <li><strong>Increases Lymphatic System Activity</strong> &ndash; Edema (swelling) has two components (Liquid &amp; Proteins) &ndash; lymph system activity is doubled thus increasing the amount and rate at which edema is evacuated and swelling is relieved (i.e., under eye swelling)</li>
                <li><strong>Increased RNA and DNA Synthesis</strong> &ndash; helps the body replace damaged cells more promptly</li>
                <li><strong>Stimulate Fibroblastic Activity</strong> &ndash; connective tissue fibers that aid in skin repair (i.e., cuts, scraps, scars, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Increases Phagocytosis</strong> &ndash; process of scavenging for and ingesting damaged and dead cells &ndash; particularly important in acne and infection control</li>
            </ul>
